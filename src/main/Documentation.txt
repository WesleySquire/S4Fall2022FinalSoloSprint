The purpose of this CLI application is to create, store, and read binary search trees.

It should be possible to use the CLI tool to:
- Create Binary Search Tree's
- Store Binary Search Tree's to a file
- Read the file containing the Binary Search Tree's

WHAT IS A BINARY SEARCH TREE
- Node-based binary tree data structure
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodes key
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the nodeâ€™s key

CREATING A NEW BINARY SEARCH TREE
- When creating new BST's you will be prompted to input a number
- This can be done an infinite amount of time's until the user want's to stop
- To stop entering numbers for the BST you must enter -0
- You will than be shown the BST you created
- From this you can enter y/n to confirm this is the BST you want stored
